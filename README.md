# Green-Vision
<h1>Product Scope</h1>
<h6>The system will take in input images of potato plants and classify them into different disease categories, such as early blight, late blight, potato virus Y, and healthy plants.The potato disease classification project aims to develop a software system that can accurately classify potato diseases based on images of potato leaves. The software system will operate within the context of an agricultural environment, specifically targeting potato crops.The software system will be used by potato farmers or agricultural experts to identify and classify diseases affecting potato plants.It will be integrated into the existing workflow of potato disease diagnosis and management, serving as a tool to aid in early disease detection and timely treatment decisions.The software system will accept input images of potato leaves, process them using image processing techniques, and classify them into different disease categories. The system will output the classification results, including the detected disease type and severity, to the user interface for further analysis and action.
